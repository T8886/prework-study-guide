# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Prework Study Guide Webpage had to be created so I as a student without any coding experience or knowledge could familiarize myself with the basics of coding, implement gained knowledge, while follow instructions and get an understanding of how it would feel to be a programmer. Overall it was a really positive experience, I had a trouble during adding SSh key to github, however with additional help from tutor I was able to successed. During prework assignment I learned what HTML, CSS and JavaScript is, why and when languages should be used. It was also explained what Git and GitHub is and when I would have to use it as a programmer. It is a very useful assignment because it allows student new to the subject learn theory and implement it on practice right away.
